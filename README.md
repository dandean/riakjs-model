riakjs-model has been superseded by [Tubbs](http://github.com/dandean/tubbs)
============================================================================

**Go check it out!**

**Tubbs** has many more features, and abstracts out the Riak connection, allowing
you to connect your models to any persistence type.

If you really need it, you can find the original code for riakjs-model in the
"original" branch of this repository.
